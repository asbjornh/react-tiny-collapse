TinyCollapse is a lightweight component for making animated expand / collapse components. It measures the height and applies it inline so you can add a transition (works when children change too).

### Browser support:

TinyCollapse needs `requestAnimationFrame` in order to do its thing, so make sure to add polyfills if you need to support older browsers (like IE9 and below).

### Why it exists

I really like [react-collapse](https://github.com/nkbt/react-collapse) and I've used it a lot. It does have some drawbacks though, such as being dependent on [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) and not playing nice with server side rendering (as of v4). I wanted to create a more lightweight, dependency-free alternative.

### Other Tiny libraries

- [react-tiny-transition](https://github.com/asbjornh/react-tiny-transition)
- [react-tiny-crossfade](https://github.com/asbjornh/react-tiny-crossfade)

### Install

```console
npm install --save react-tiny-collapse
```

## API

**animateChildren** : Boolean = `false`
<br/>Animates height when children changes (set to `false` when nesting collapses)

---

**children** : React element
<br/>Stuff you want to expand / collapse (one root node only)

---

**className** : String

---

**component** : String | Function component = `"div"`
<br/>Type of element used for the wrapper node
<br/>If a function component is used it _must_ use `React.forwardRef`

---

**componentProps** : Object
<br/>Additional props passed to the wrapper component
<br/>If `componentProps` includes a `style` property, some individual styles may be overridden by the inline styles set by `react-tiny-collapse`.

---

**duration** : Number = `500`
<br/>Transition duration (milliseconds)

---

**easing** : String = `cubic-bezier(0.3,0,0,1)`
<br/>CSS easing function

---

**forceInitialAnimation** : Boolean = `false`
<br/>Force animation when TinyCollapse mounts open

---

**isOpen** : Boolean = `false`
<br/>Shows or hides the content

---

**onMeasure** : Function
<br/>Called whenever TinyCollapse measures height

```jsx
<TinyCollapse onMeasure={height => doStuff(height)}>
  <div>Stuff</div>
</TinyCollapse>
```

---

**unmountChildren** : Boolean = `false`
<br/>Unmounts children when closed

---

## Example usage:

```jsx
import TinyCollapse from "react-tiny-collapse";

...

<TinyCollapse isOpen={this.state.isOpen}>
  <div>Content</div>
</TinyCollapse>
```

## Nested TinyCollapse

When using nested `TinyCollapse` instances it's a good idea to set `animateChildren` to `false` on the outer one. If you don't, the outer one will measure the wrong height which will result in jaggy animation and clipping of content.
